# Community & Discussions

Welcome! This project vendors OpenAI Codex and adds a practical SOLO mode for continuous, testable progress. We try to keep it fun, inclusive, and useful.

- Discussions: enable GitHub Discussions in your repo Settings and start threads for ideas, show‑and‑tell, and Q&A.
- Issues: use the templates for Bugs and Features.
- Code of Conduct: be respectful; focus on ideas and code, not people.
- Roadmap: propose milestones in Discussions; maintainers will triage and label issues.

Guidelines
- Keep PRs small and focused; include tests when adding behavior.
- Share reproductions and logs for bugs.
- Prefer `success_sh` checks (exit 0) for reliable SOLO success signals.

Have an idea for a template, tool, or integration? Open a thread — we welcome contributions of all sizes.
